# XcooBee Cookie Kit

## What is the XCK

The objective of the XcooBee Cookie Kit (XCK) is to enable third party websites to connect to XcooBee for the purposes of improvement cookie consent management for both their users and themselves.

The XCK makes it easy to plugin cookie consent into your website. It will handle all user interaction to obtain consent and let the website know which cookies can be used witch which users while they visit their website. Similarly, your website can now be informed when users change their consent even when they are not visiting it.

THe XCK is one of the most transparent and frictionless ways to manage cookies on your site. It will not pop-up, in, or otherwise hinder the user experience when it is not needed. Yet, at the same time, it provides full compliance with European e-directives and related GDPR rules. 

Website owners can easily react to data-requests, and report on privacy related requests if needed via the XcooBee network.

The XCK does not require a XcooBee connection to work for your website. You will still have access to the majority of user consent gathering but loose central insight and management.
